                You find yourself in Dante's shoes, blocked from the Mount of Joy.<br>
                Using human reason, you must descend and recognize sin.

                    I AM THE WAY INTO THE CITY OF WOE.<br>
                    I AM THE WAY TO A FORSAKEN PEOPLE.<br>
                    I AM THE WAY INTO ETERNAL SORROW.<br>
                    <br>
                    SACRED JUSTICE MOVED MY ARCHITECT.<br>
                    I WAS RAISED HERE BY DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE,<br>
                    PRIMORDIAL LOVE AND ULTIMATE INTELLECT.<br>
                    <br>
                    ONLY THOSE ELEMENTS TIME CANNOT WEAR<br>
                    WERE MADE BEFORE ME, AND BEYOND TIME I STAND.<br>
                    <strong>ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE.</strong><br>

                You stand at the gate of Hell, being able to overhear the cries of The Opportunists. <br>
                The first river of Hell, Acheron, sits ways away from you. Charon may ferry you over, if you wish.
