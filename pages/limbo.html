                    YOU DO NOT QUESTION WHAT SOULS THESE ARE<br> THAT SUFFER HERE BEFORE YOU?<br>
                    I WISH YOU TO KNOW BEFORE YOU TRAVEL ON<br> THAT THESE WERE SINLESS. AND STILL THEIR MERITS FAIL,<br>
                    FOR THEY LACKED BAPTISM'S GRACE,<br> WHICH IS THE DOOR OF THE TRUE FAITH YOU WERE BORN TO.<br>

                <p class="text"><span>
                    Here you see the souls of those who lived sinlessly but existed before Christ.<br>
                    Unable to reach Heaven, they are reserved a paradise in Hell,<br>
                    their only torment being the hopelessness of never being able to ascend.<br>
                    <br>
                    You recognize the faces of great figuers such as Aristotle, Homer, and Caesar.
