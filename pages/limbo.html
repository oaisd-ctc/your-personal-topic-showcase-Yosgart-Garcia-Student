                    YOU DO NOT QUESTION WHAT SOULS THESE ARE<br> THAT SUFFER HERE BEFORE YOU?<br>
                    <strong>I WISH YOU TO KNOW BEFORE YOU TRAVEL ON<br> THAT THESE WERE SINLESS. AND STILL THEIR MERITS
                        FAIL,</strong><br>

                You come across a beautiful sight, a complete contrast to the Hellish landscape you expected...<br>
                <br>Here you see the souls of those who lived sinlessly but existed before Christ.<br>
                Unable to reach Heaven, they are reserved a paradise in Hell,<br>
                their only torment being the hopelessness of never being able to ascend.<br>
                <br><em>You realize that you will never have the opportunity to reside here in your afterlife.</em><br>
                <br>
                You recognize the faces of great figures, some being:

                <li>Homer</li>
