                Your citizens nicknamed nme Ciacco, The Hog:<br>
                <strong>gluttony was my offense, and for it<br>
                    I lie here rotting like a swollen log.</strong><br>
                <br>
                Nor am I lost in this alone; all these<br>
                you see about you in this painful death<br>
                have wallowed in the same indecencies.<br>

            Here you come upon the horrible sight of Cerberus ripping and tearing apart the gluttons.<br>
            They in life wallowed in food and drinks, producing not much more than garbage.<br>
            Here, they themselves lie in the slush of their putrid excess.
