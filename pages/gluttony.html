                You find yourself in Dante's shoes, blocked from the Mount of Joy.<br>
                Using human reason, you must descend and recognize sin.

                    <strong>gluttony was my offense, and for it<br>
                    I lie here rotting like a swollen log.</strong><br>

                You stand at the gate of Hell, being able to overhear the cries of The Opportunists. <br>
                The first river of Hell, Acheron, sits ways away from you. Charon may ferry you over, if you wish.
