            <em>Man, Hell must suck,</em> you think to yourself as you shamefully walk back up the convinient set of
            stairs<br>

        </p>

                <br>1st circle of Hell, a heaven "at home" for the Virtuous Pagans.

                <br><h3>Lust:</h3><br>
                <img src="../images/lust.jpg" alt="The storm of lust." width="500" height="300">
                <br>2nd circle of Hell, here the punishment is light: that of flying in a storm eternally.

            <section>
                <br><h3>Gluttony:</h3><br>
                <img src="../images/gluttony.jpg" alt="The storm of lust." width="500" height="300">
                <br>3rd circle of Hell, the punishment is quite painful and disgusting: laying in putrid sludge while
                waiting to be eaten alive by Cerberus.
            </section>
            <section>
                <br><h3>Greed:</h3><br>

                <br>4th circle of Hell, where the punishment is a futile duel encumbered by weights.
            </section>
            <br>These are the sins of self-control. The most common and the hardest to break out of. The sins of the
            she-wolf.
