                        their misering or extravagance mocked all reason.</strong></em><br>
                <br>
                The voice of each clamors its own excess<br>
                when lust meets lust at the two points of the circle<br>
                where oppoosite guilts meet in their wretchedness.<br>

            <br>As you watch the hoarders and wasters face off for all eternity, burdened to repeat the same endless
            task<br>
            just as King Sisyphus. Here among the hoarders you find your fork!<br>
            This whole Hell place is pretty scary, so you want to leave immediately<br>
            <br><em>And you don't want to imagine what those in the lower layers are suffering through...</em><br>
