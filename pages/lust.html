                    NOW THE CHOIR OF ANGUISH, LIKE A WOUND, STRIKES THROUGH THE TORTURED AIR.<br>
                    NOW I HAVE COME TO HELL'S FULL LAMENTATION, <strong>SOUND BEYONG SOUND.</strong><br>

                    Here you see the souls of those who lived sinlessly but existed before Christ.<br>
                    Unable to reach Heaven, they are reserved a paradise in Hell,<br>
                    their only torment being the hopelessness of never being able to ascend.<br>
                    <br>
                    You recognize the faces of great figuers such as Aristotle, Homer, and Caesar.
